          to: Current
          details:
              - Rewrote from scratch the old patron manager using AngularJS and a REST
                API.
              - Helped an intern, later hired by the company, to learn the tools and
                develop his potential as a software engineer.
              - Integrated seamlessly the Angular application in the legacy Zend
                application sharing authentication between the API and the legacy PHP
                application.
              - Worked using Agile methodologies following the SCRUM approach.

              - Resolved performance issues for a very big client. Being the first
                client of that size, for the first time the product was delivered
                with multiple instances all working on the same database and this
                put the whole infrastructure to the test. Spotting the bottlenecks

                accomplishments.
              - Mantained existing Python code using a custom web framework.
                Refactoring and the introduction of some unit tests were the added

                Jenkins CI to run tests and verify the coverage.
              - Automated the software installation and some end-to-end tests
                through the watir-webdriver Ruby gem.
