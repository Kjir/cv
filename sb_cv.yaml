          location: Gualdo Tadino, Italy
          from: Jul. 2015
          to: Sep. 2016
          details:
              - Rewrote from scratch the old patron manager using AngularJS and a REST
                API.
              - Helped an intern, later hired by the company, to learn the tools and

                application.
              - Worked using Agile methodologies following the SCRUM approach.

          to: Jun. 2015
          details:
              - Introduced SOAP and REST/json webservices on the application

              - Resolved performance issues for a very big client. Being the first
                client of that size, for the first time the product was delivered
                with multiple instances all working on the same database and this
                put the whole infrastructure to the test. Spotting the bottlenecks

                accomplishments.
              - Mantained existing Python code using a custom web framework.
                Refactoring and the introduction of some unit tests were the added
                value put on top of normal development work. Also setup a local
                Jenkins CI to run tests and verify the coverage.
              - Automated the software installation and some end-to-end tests
                through the watir-webdriver Ruby gem.
